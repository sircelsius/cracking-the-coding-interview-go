# Cracking the Go Coding Interview

Go implementations of questions from ["Cracking the Coding Interview"](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, 6th edition.

Implementations are arranged under `/pkg/<chapter_name>/<question_headline>`.

The implementations are my own and may differ from those offered in the book.

## Running the tests

```bash
go test ./pkg/..
```
